Getting Started
---------------

After forking/cloning this git repository, you should have the following folders and files:

    |-src/
    	|-includes/
    		|-layout.jade
    	|-about.jade
    	|-index.jade
    |-bower.json
    |-package.json
    |-readme.md

You should first install the dependencies by running a `bower install` while your current working directory is the root folder of this project. This will retrieve jquery and bootstrap (this project only requires bootstrap) and place them in the `bower_components` folder.

Next, you should make sure you install the npm dependencies by running a `npm install` also inside the root folder of this project.
