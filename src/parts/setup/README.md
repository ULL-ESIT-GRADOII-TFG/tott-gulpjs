# Setup

The first step is to pull the boilerplate for this tutorial from github. 
Make sure you have [`git`](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Run the following command in a shell to pull the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/Coalman/tott-gulpjs.git

Once it's finished, you should have a directory named `tott-gulpjs` in your
current directory.
