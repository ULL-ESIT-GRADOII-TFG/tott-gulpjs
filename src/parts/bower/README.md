Bower is a front-end package manager built on top of Git. Handling dependencies 
manually is a pain. You have to go to a website, download some files, unpack 
them, and then replace the old one for each dependency every time you need to 
update them. A package manager automates all of this, making this entire process 
as easy as running a few commands on the command line.
