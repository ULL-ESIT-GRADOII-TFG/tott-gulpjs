# Step 1: Install Bower

The first step is to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Use your 
distribution's package manager or download the installer if you're on 
Windows.

After installing `node.js`, we need to install `bower`. You can use `npm` 
to install `bower`:

```
$ npm install --global bower
# you can run the following line to test if bower installed correctly
$ bower -h
```
