# Step 2: Install some Dependencies

Now that we have a working `bower` installation, it's time to install 
some dependencies. The webpage we are trying to build uses 
[Bootstrap]() and [Font Awesome](), so we'll install these using bower.

Run the following commands:

```
$ bower install bootstrap
$ bower install fontawesome
```

If everything goes well, you should have a directory named 
`bower_components` with the dependencies inside.
