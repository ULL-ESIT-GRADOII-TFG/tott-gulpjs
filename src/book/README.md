# Introduction

Goals:

* Learn what a task runner is
* Learn how to install gulp and access gulp plugins
* Edit an example gulp file to build an example project

Gulp.js is a new task runner that automates repetitive, frontend build tasks. It can automate the process of linting your JavaScript, compressing images, minifying JavaScript, and many other common web dev tasks.

So why should we care about task runners? Well, currently frontend development requires a lot of build tasks. We need to minify css/html, compile templates, compress images, compile TypeScript/CoffeeScript/Dart/Sass/LESS/Stylus files, and do all kinds of other things. Task runners can automate all of these tasks. Once you configure a task runner, it can save you huge amounts of time.
